### WHAT IS A DOCKER?

- Docker is a software platform which allows us to build, test, run and deploy application fast.

### DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VIRTUAL MACHINE AND CONTAINERS

- ```Virtual machines``` allows to virtualize an entire machine down to the hardware layers while ```Containers``` only virtualize software layers above the operating system level and this is an isolated environment which allows us to throw in software to run smoothly. 
- Containers are lighter because they do not need their own operating systems.Â
